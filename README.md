# Nike Android Excerise

This is the Base Project for Nike Android Excerise.
It provides a number of key pieces to help you get started on the NAT.

Make an Urban Dictionary app.

·       Write your code in Kotlin
·       DO NOT force unwrap your code or show signs of forced unwrapping your code.
·       Include a text input for users to enter the term they wish to search.
·       Show the list of resulting definitions, with number of thumbs up and thumbs down votes. Use a RecyclerView for this list.
·       Allow users to sort by either most thumbs up or down.
·       Show a progress indication while the Urban Dictionary API call is being made.
·       Write at least one unit test and one instrumented test and be prepared to talk about what other test cases you think would be beneficial to write.
·       Document all assumptions.



While this is a toy project and not a professional product, take care to demonstrate your ability to architect clean, maintainable and self-documenting code.

Provide your application via a link to a public Git repo (GitHub, Gitorious, etc).
